# 1. When ProcessPool start is called, it creates _ventilator_send, _control_sender and _result_receiver
#    sockets.
# 2. After initialization is done, worker process sends _WORKER_STARTED_INDICATOR
# 3. Once ProcessPool receives _WORKER_STARTED_INDICATOR from all workers, the ProcessPool
#    is ready to start ventilating.
#
# 4. Each ventilated message is picked up by one of the workers.
# 5. Worker process would send 0..n responses for each ventilated message. Each response
#    is a tuple of (data payload, control). Data payload is serialized using
#    _serializer instance. Control is always pickled.
# 6. After the last response to a single ventilated item is transmitted, an instance of VentilatedItemProcessedMessage
#    is transmitted as a control. This control message is needed to count how many ventilated
#    items are being processed at each time.
#
# 7. Workers are terminated by broadcasting _CONTROL_FINISHED message.
